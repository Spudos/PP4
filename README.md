## Design

### Colors

The color scheme was chosen to provide a good contrast for accessibility whilst also being quite subtle.  The black for the header and social footer was given a transparency of 90% to make it less harsh.

The images were then created with a blue gradient/orange theme to add more color and interest to the site.

### Fonts

 The font selected was sans-serif with different sizing, weight and spacing used to add interest to the text.

##### Back to [top](#table-of-contents)<hr>

## Structure

The site was designed for the user to find the layout simple to use and navigate through.

The header contains a top section in black which contains the company name and login/logout/sign up functions.  Below that is the nav bar colored beige.

The footer is in two sections, mirroring the header.  The beige section includes location and contact information with the black section containing links for the site owners social accounts.

### Website pages

- The site consists of the following pages:

  Welcome page

  The Blog
  - Blog listing
  - Blog detail

  Sessions
  - Session Listing
  - Session Booking
  - No Sessions Available
  - Session Booked

  Contact me
  - Contact form
  - Contact Success

  User account

  Note:
  Django admin template were used for all admin functions hence there was no need to design a specific page for this

## ElephantSQL

ElephantSQL was used to host the SQL database.

This elegant solution allows cloud based storage to be used so the same DB can be used at all time.  This is especially useful during development as local and deployed versions can be tested with the same data saving time and aiding consistency of results.
